The candelabra lily is a bulbous perennial that sprouts a large spherical and showy inflorescence in late summer, bearing up to 80 red flowers on long pedicels and reaching up to 600mm in diameter. Flowers are curved upwards. The fruits have three heavily ribbed wings. Five to six leathery leaves appear on the ground only after the inflorescence has dried and snapped off.
