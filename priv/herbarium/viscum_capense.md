Perennial obligate (needs host to complete lifecycle) stem hemiparasite (relies on host for water and nutrients but is able to photosynthesize). Produces numerous orange to red berries in autumn. The dominant host in the Hex is the sand olive *Dodonaea viscosa angustifolia*, but *Searsia undulata* can also act as a host. A tea can be brewed from the dre stems and leaves, especially when hosted on the num-num *Carissa macrocarpa*.
