Cormous herbaceous perennial with tuft of strap-like leaves (10-30 cm). The stem bears a few leaves and a one-sided (secund) spike of flowers (August). Each flower has 6 tepals (no distinction between petals ans sepals) shaped into a fragrant funnel. Flowers range in colour from beige, orange, red to purple, changing colour with age. The stem turns almost at a right angle below the the first flower so that the flowers are arranged in what looks like a comb ("kammetjie") parallel to the ground.
