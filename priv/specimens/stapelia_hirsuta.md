Succulent with multiple short leafless bulky gray green stems. Produces a star-shaped flower at the base of the stems with alternate dark red and yellow sripes along the breadth. Hairs on the flower margins and very woolly towards the centre. The flower produces a putrid smell which lures flies which pollinate the flower. Fly eggs can often be found on the flower wool.
