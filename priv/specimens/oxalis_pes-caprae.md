Stemless perennial geophyte. Leaves originate from a basal whorl or tuft. Each leave is divided into three heart-shaped leaflets; hairless on top, hairy underneath. Bears clusters of bright yellow flowers on a long peduncle from late autumn to spring.

*O. pes-caprae* is probably the best known Oxalis species, often conspicuously covering vast stretches of fields and often seen on roadsides
and damaged landscapes. The peduncles and flowers are edible, but quite sour.
