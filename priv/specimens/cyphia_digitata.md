Specimens in Hex more closely match the description of *C. polydactyla* which is now considered to be synonymous with *C. digitata*.

### Distribution in the Hex

Sandy flats in De Doorns Sandstone Fynbos and possible Hex River Arid Alluvium Fynbos. Sandy slopes or clay flats in De Doorns Renosterveld Karoo (both in more Renosterveld-like and
more Karoo-like vegetation).
