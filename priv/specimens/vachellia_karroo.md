Shrub or small tree to 12 m. Bears straight spines or thorns (armed). Leaves are bipinnate. Bright yellow flowers
in rounded heads from November to December. Pods are flat, curved and constricted between seeds.

The town of De Doorns ("the thorns") is so named because of the prevalence of this species in the Hex River Valley.

*V. karroo* was previously known as *Acacia karroo*, but the name *Acacia* now only applies to the Australasian species.
