Shrub to 1.5 m. Male and female flowers on same or different plants. Leaves lance-shaped, channeled,
sparsely hairy and very prickly. Leaves closer to flowers are shorter and densely hairy. Male flowers
have about 12 stamens. Female flowers have an egg-shaped receptacle and red, feathery styles.

The name "bergklimmersvriend" is used in irony, because the leaves deliver painful stings. An alternative
anecdotal explanation is that the plant possesses a strong root system and thus provides good support to a
climber losing her balance.
