covered in small pitted scales (lepidote-stellate). Tapered or oval shaped
leaflike-appendages (stipules) attached to petioles. Leaves crowded together on
short petioles (fascicled). The leaf blades are dark gray green, wedge-shaped (cuneate),
folded length-wise (conduplicate) and toothed at the apex (crenate). Bears flowers on
a raceme of secund (arrangend on one side only) cymes on terminal branchlets. Bracts on
