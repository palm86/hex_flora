# rewrite with less jargon

Geophyte up to 20 cm with a stem evident above ground. The leaves are trifoliolate with linear-elliptic leaflets that are covered
in fine glandular hairs. The flowers (April to July) are lilac to white with a yellow tube. Glandular hair sometimes visible on the outside of the tube.

_Oxalis ciliaris_ appears similar to _Oxalis burkei_ but the latter has finer hairless leaves and flowers and is found in the
De Doorns Renosterveld Karoo vegetation type. The two species co-occur in the ecotone between the two vegetation types.
