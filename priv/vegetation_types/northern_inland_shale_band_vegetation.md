            5.6.11 Mesic Montane Fynbos on shaleband
Within the domain two montane shaleband units are recognised in Mucina & Rutherford (2006) and these are the Northern Inland Shaleband (mainly on Hex River Mts.) and the Western Coastal Shaleband (west of the Breede river). Both are further described in that reference, and are typical features of the high mountains, often most prominent as the saddles between peaks. In some instances they can be hard to recognise floristically or structurally, especially where sandstone scree has largely covered the shales. Once again Hakea sericea and pine are a serious problem in places.

Mucina & Rutherford

Distribution Western Cape Province: Narrow shale band from
Mount Synnott near the Pakhuis Pass in the Cederberg, to the
Skurweberg, Koue Bokkeveld, Groot Winterhoek, Hex River
and Keeroms Mountains. Small portions of this shale band unit
are found at Piketberg and Breëvlei north of Het Kruis. Altitude
400–1 650 m, with extremes from 100 m to lower altitude lim-
its of FFs 30 Western Altimontane Sandstone Fynbos. See also
Figure 4.78 featuring the simpliﬁed distribution of this unit.

Vegetation & Landscape Features A
narrow 80–200 m linear feature, smooth
and ﬂat in proﬁle compared to surround-
ing areas and thus favoured for paths
and roads. The dominant landscape of
the Cederberg (the long, linear plateaus)
is often associated with the shale bands.
At present the vegetation of this unit
encompasses diverse shrublands rang-
ing from karoo at lower altitudes and
northerly aspects, renosterveld at low
and medium altitudes on various aspects,
to fynbos at higher altitudes and also
much lower on southern aspects. Fynbos
includes all structural types; it is often
quite grassy in character, and usually
waboomveld occurs at the lowest alti-
tudes. Heuweltjies prominent in northern
portion of the band.
Geology & Soils Clays derived from
shales of the Cedarberg Formation. Land
types mainly Ic and Ib.
Climate MAP 250–1 360 mm (mean:
590 mm), peaking from May to August.
(FFb) in the Fynbos Biome.
Mean daily maximum and minimum tem-
peratures 27.2°C and 3.4°C for February
and July, respectively. Frost incidence
10–30 days per year. See also climate
diagram for FFb 1 Northern Inland Shale Band Vegetation
(Figure 4.77).
