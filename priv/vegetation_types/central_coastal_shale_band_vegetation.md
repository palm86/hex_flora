Distribution

Western Cape Province: A virtually continuous band traversing the entire length of the Langeberg, with bands in the eastern regions of the Outeniqua Mountaina nd of the Grootberg-Amandelbosberg as well as some area, for example, Die Bergies, west of Mossel Baye. THe exten of the shale band in the Outeniqua Mountains has not been adequately mapped and its eastern boundary remains unknown. Altitude 50-1700m.

Vegetation & Landscape Features

A narrow 80-200m linear feature (wider in places), smooth and flat in profile compared to surrounding areas. Vegetation comprises various fynbos shrublands.

Geology & Soils
Clays derived from shale band of the Cedarberg Formation. Land types mainly Ib, Ic, and Db.

Climate
MAP 280-1560 mm (mean 680mm), relatively even with a low in December-January. Southeasterly cloud brings heavy mist precipitation at higher altitudes in summer. Mean daily maximum and minimum temperatures 22.2 and 4.8 C for January and July. Frost incidence 3-10 days per year.

Conservation
Least threatened. Target 27%. About 25%
conserved in statutory and local-authority reserves such as
Boosmansbos Wilderness Area, Marloth, Garcia, Tygerberg,
Montagu Mountain, Ruitersbos, Twistniet and Spioenkop. In
addition 43% enjoys protection in mountain catchment areas
such as Langeberg-wes, Langeberg-oos and Matroosberg.
Some 15% transformed (mainly cultivation, but also pine plan-
tations). Aliens such as Pinus pinaster, Hakea sericea and Acacia
mearnsii are locally of concern. Erosion very low and low.
