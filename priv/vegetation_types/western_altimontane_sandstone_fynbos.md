Du Toits Koof Sandstone Fynbos is a further segregate of Hawequas Sandstone Fynbos, but is probably slightly drier than the latter.  Parts of it have been burnt too often, and Hakea sericea and pine are a serious problem in places.  The unit spans a major altitudinal gradient from about 300 to 1600m, and could clearly be further subdivided. Western Altimontane Fynbos occurs above 1600m, in areas with regular winter snowfalls. All the usual seepage areas, Afrotemperate Forest patches, cliffs, rocky areas and shalebands are found within this unit, hugely increasing the available habitat diversity. Specials include various restioids, Spatalla salsoloides, Serruria zeyheri and Oreoleysera montana.

M & R

from around 1 800 m upwards including patches on Jurie se
Berg (Sneeukoppe; 1 930 m), Shadow Peak (1 898 m) and
Sneeuberg (2 026 m) in the Cederberg, Sneeukop (2 071 m) in
Skurweberge, Groot Winterhoek Peak (2 078 m), Eureka Peak
(1 987 m), Medina Peak (1 905 m) and Sneeugat Peak (1 884
m), Groot Winterhoek, as well as a series of larger patches
along the Hex River Mountains on Mosterthoek Twins (2 030
m), Waaihoek Peak (1 948 m), Mount Superior (1 913 m),
Fonteintjiesberg (1 989 m), Sentinel Peak (1 939 m), Buffelshoek

in the extreme west of the Langeberg as well as Du Toits Peak

Vegetation & Landscape Features High-altitude sum-
mit peaks, generally fragmented and localised, but relatively
extensive in the Hex River Mountains. Vegetation in these high-
altitude positions is low, open to medium dense restioid fyn-
bos, with ericaceous and asteraceous fynbos occurring locally.
Proteoid fynbos generally absent.
Geology & Soils Skeletal and rocky acidic lithosol soils derived
from Ordovician sandstones of the Table Mountain Group (Cape
Supergroup). Land types mainly Ic and Ib.
Climate MAP generally 450–3 140 mm (mean: 1 385 mm),
peaking May to August. Mean daily maximum and minimum
temperatures 22.9°C and 0.1°C for February and July.
