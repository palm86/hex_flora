(Moll & Bossi 1983). Inland Renoster Shrubland (Campbell 1985). LR 61

Distribution Western Cape Province: From De Doorns and the
top of the Theronsberg Pass in the west to Gamka Poort in the
east, remaining north of the Waboomberg and Warmwaterberg
in the Little Karoo and north of the Anysberg and Groot
Swartberg and positioned south of the Tanqua Karoo, the
Grootrivier near Matjiesfontein and the Floriskraal Dam south-
east of Laingsburg. This type surrounds the many higher eleva-
tion ridges of FFq 3 Matjiesfontein Quartzite Fynbos and FFh 2
Matjiesfontein Shale Fynbos. Altitude 750–1 300 m.
Vegetation & Landscape Features Low mountains, paral-
lel hills and mid-altitude plateaus supporting a low, open to
medium dense, leptophyllous shrubland with a medium dense
matrix of short, divaricate shrubs, dominated by renosterbos.
Heuweltjies present at low densities in places.
Geology & Soils Clays and loams derived from Witteberg and
Bokkeveld Group shales of the Cape Supergroup; Glenrosa and
Mispah forms prominent. Land types mainly Fc, Ic, Ib and Fb.
Climate MAP 150–470 mm (mean: 300 mm), peaking slightly
from May to August. Mean daily maximum and minimum tem-
peratures 27.4°C and 2.4°C for February and July, respectively.
Frost incidence 10–40 days per year. See also climate diagram
for FRs 6 Matjiesfontein Shale Renosterveld (Figure 4.101).
Important Taxa Low Shrubs: Elytropappus rhinocerotis
(d), Aspalathus alpestris, Asparagus capensis var. capen-
sis, Athanasia ﬂexuosa, Chrysocoma ciliata, C. oblongifolia,
Reference Acocks (1988).

eration of renosterveld shrubland on the Hex River Pass, with ﬂora
rich in dwarf shrubs (Hermannia, Indigofera), annuals and geophytes

Matroosberg (2 249 m) is in the background.
Eriocephalus ericoides subsp. ericoides, Euryops cuneatus, E.
imbricatus, E. microphyllus, Helichrysum simulans, Oedera
genistifolia, Passerina truncata subsp. truncata, Pteronia sor-
dida. Succulent Shrub: Antimima dasyphylla. Herbs: Cotula
macroglossa, Foveolina dichotoma, Lepidium desertorum,
Rhynchopsidium sessiliﬂorum, Rumex lanceolatus, Ursinia nana.
Geophytic Herbs: Chlorophytum lewisiae, Gethyllis campanulata,
Romulea atrandra, R. sphaerocarpa, R. tortuosa, Trachyandra
thyrsoidea. Succulent Herb: Crassula lanceolata subsp. lan-
ceolata. Graminoids: Bromus pectinatus, Ehrharta calycina, E.
capensis, E. delicatula, Hyparrhenia hirta, Hypodiscus sulcatus,
Pentaschistis rigidissima.
Endemic Taxa Low Shrub: Lotononis comptonii. Geophytic
Herbs: Disa cochlearis, Hesperantha truncatula, Romulea
malaniae.
Conservation Least threatened. Target 27%. About 7% in
total conserved in the Anysberg Nature Reserve (CapeNature)
and private conservation areas such as Rooikrans. Some 9%
totally transformed (mainly cultivation). Erosion moderate to
very low as well as very high in places.
Remarks This is a very poorly studied vegetation unit. Although
grouped with FRs 5 Central Mountain Shale Renosterveld by
Acocks (1988), this unit has more fynbos and fewer karoo ele-
ments. This unit also occurs in the FFb 3 Central Inland Shale
Fynbos Biome

Band Vegetation at moderate altitudes (1 300 m), but has not
been mapped as its extent is uncertain.
