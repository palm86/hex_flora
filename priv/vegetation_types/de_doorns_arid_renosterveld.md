De Doorns Arid Renosterveld is a pure (non-mosaic) Renosterveld habitat that is restricted to the Rietvlei private reserve and adjacent airfield near the town of De Doorns.

The terrain is completely flat with a small seasonal creek carving through the shale soil.

Fynbos and Karoo elements are largely absent. A special floristic feature is the abundance of the regional endemic *Amphithalea spinosa*.
