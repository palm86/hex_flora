De Doorns Sandstone Fynbos is a transitional vegetation type that stretches from Hexrivier in the south west along the lower southern slopes of the Hex River Mountains to the base of the Hex River Pass in the north east. It joins the South Hex Sandstone Fynbos, which starts at about 500 m, and the Hex River Arid Alluvial Fynbos, mostly replaced by vines, in the valley floor.

The terrain is less rugged and more gradual than South Hex and includes occasional elevated flats.

The vegetation shares similarities to South Hex, but contains elements that are often more common in Renosterveld than Fynbos. This is likely due to a loam component that remains from a weathered shale band.

Snow is not a regular winter occurance. Summer rains virtually absent.

### Important Taxa

Renosterveld-like species include *Anthospermum spathulatum*, *Pentaschistis eriostoma*, *Eriocephalus africanus* and *Searsia dissecta*. Grasses and bulbs are common. Common shrubs include *Xiphotheca reflexa*, *Protea laurifolia*, *Seriphium* sp., *Searsia* sp., *Muraltia spinosa*, *Centella* sp., *Cliffortia erectisepala*, *C. crenata*, *Aspalathus* sp. (including rooibostee), *Dodonaea viscosa angustifolia*, *Leucadendron salignum*, *Restio capensis* and *Corymbium africanum*.

### Endemic Taxa

Unknown, but probably includes a number of bulbs and smaller shrubs.

### Conservation

Probably not significantly threatened by agricultural activities due to higher elevation and slopes, but not officially conserved. Black wattle (*Acacia mearnsii*) is a serious threat in some locations.
