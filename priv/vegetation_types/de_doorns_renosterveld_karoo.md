The De Doorns Renosterveld Karoo vegetation type is located in the north eastern part of the Hex River Valley, ranging from the old Osplaas Railway Station to the Hex River Pass. It is for the most part indistinguishable from the Worcester Renosterveld Karoo or Robertson Karoo units, but supports at least one local endemic, *Amphithalea spinosa*, and *Vachellia karoo* may be present.

The terrain is characterized by numerous small buttes (koppies) and mesas (tafelberge).

The vegetation is fairly homogenous with Renosterveld (and even Fynbos) elements dominating southern slopes and Karoo elements prominent on northern slopes. "Heuweltjies", lush circular patches supporting larger shrubs like *Euclea undulata*, *Searsia undulata*, *Tylecodon paniculatus* and others, are a common occurrence.

Winter rainfall with occasional summer thunderstorms. Relatively dry.

### Important Taxa

*Tylecodon paniculatis*, *Pteronia* spp., *Crassula rupestris*, *Othonna arbuscula*, *Euryops tenuissimus*, *Dicerothamnus rhinocerotis*, *Searsia undulata*, *Euclea undulata*, *Eriocephalus* spp., *Aizoon africanus*, *Euphorbia mauritanica*, and *Aloe microstigma*

### Endemic Taxa

Unknown for the most part. *Amphitalea spinosa* is shared with only De Doorns Arid Renosterveld. Other outliers (not endemic, but unusual for this unit) include *Cyanella alba* and *Stachys rugosa*.

### Conservation

Large sections of this vegetation type have been replaced by vines, but much of the remaining parts is conserved or not suitable for agriculture.
