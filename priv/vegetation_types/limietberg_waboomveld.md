5.6.18	Waboomveld
This is a fairly major Fynbos habitat, with at least five units recognised, split up primarily on their distribution, and they are thus not described separately, except for their specials.  Mucina & Rutherford (2006) included most of these units within Sandstone Fynbos types, and indeed they are very similar.  Waboomveld usually occurs on sandstones, but may also occur on shales, often at the base of the steeper slopes (such as at Brandwacht and Slanghoek), where it then shares many elements with Shaleband Vegetation.  Waboomveld usually occurs at lower elevations than the montane forms of Sandstone Fynbos, and the climate is thus drier and hotter, although this is partially influenced by aspect.  It seems that more frequent fires may both create and maintain Waboomveld, as the habitat is dominated by resprouting species such as Protea nitida (the waboom), Leucadendron salignum, Montinia caryophyllacea, Corymbium africanum, Lanaria lanata, various restios, sedges and grasses and Diosma hirsuta. Other common species include Metalasia densa, Aspalathus rugosa, Ischyrolepis gaudichaudiana, and in older areas Leucadendron rubrum and Protea repens. Ericaceae usually rare. Heeria argentea is often prominent on rocky ridges that escape fire. Alien vegetation is often a major problem, especially Acacia mearnsii, Hakea sericea and pines.

Limietberg Waboomveld supports the localised endemic Salvia thermarum on the Badsberg, plus Protea burchellii and possibly P. scorzonerifolia and Aspalathus lenticula. Hex & Witzenberg, Brandvlei, and South Langeberg Waboomveld have no known specials, other than Protea burchellii.  Stormsvlei Waboomveld may support a number of specials known for nearby including Linconia ericoides, Campylostachys sp. nov. and Athanasia oocephala.
